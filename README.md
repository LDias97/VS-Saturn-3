# VS-Saturn 3
## Software Engineering I Course Project

A group project for the Software Engineering I course at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. The VS-Saturn 3 team is made up of five members who were assigned the task of creating an extension for Visual Studio Code, a free source-code editor. The idea of the extension stems from the Pomodoro Technique for time management.
