### Updates

**Version 0.5.1**

Started creating the timer. Added buttons and functionality behind the buttons to start/pause the timer, reset the timer, skip the current break, and snooze (add 5 minutes to the running timer). Additionally, started working on a "non-intrusive" way to show whether the timer is on "break time" (switch to light theme) or on "running time" (switch to dark theme).

**Version 0.1**

First iteration of the VS-Saturn extension. Simply uses Microsoft's VS Code API to output two different types of messages to the screen: a basic text message and an alert message.
